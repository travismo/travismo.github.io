      Hilbert's tenth problem was to give an algorithm which took as input a
      polynomial with integer coefficients and would output YES if that polynomial had
      an integer zero and NO otherwise. Matiyasevich, building on work of Davis, Putnam, and Robinson,
      showed that no such algorithm can exist. One can rephrase H10 then over other rings, such
      as the rationals. It is not known whether there exists an algorithm which takes a rational
      polynomial as input and decides whether it has a rational zero. If the integers
      were diophantine over the rationals (i.e. cut out by polynomial equations or, to be precise,
      defined by a first order existential formula) then H10 over the rationals would also be undecidable.
      While it is generally not believed that the integers are diophantine over the rationals, studying
      the diophantine sets still sheds light on the first order theory of these rings. If Z were
      not diophantine over Q, we may still hope to give a first order definition of it. Robinson
      gave the first, which was improved by Poonen. Koenigsmann showed the integers are defined
      by a universal formula; equivalently, the non-integral rationals are diophantine!

      In this
      talk, I will give an introduction to decidability and definability in number theory
      and discuss some of my work in this area, namely on first-order universal definitions of
      S-integers in global function fields and on the diophantineness of some quirky sets, like the
      collection of non-nth powers in a global field (originally a result of Colliot-Thelene and Van Geel, which
      we recover by showing that the non-norms of a cyclic extension are diophantine).

To prevent timing attacks, cryptographic protocols are usually implemented using constant-time algorithms; that is, algorithms whose running time is independent of any secret information. Often, these constant-time algorithms are implemented using dummy operations: operations which are performed but whose results are discarded. Dummy operations can lead to fault attacks: attacks which are designed to learn secret information by creating errors during computations. In this talk, I will discuss the Commutative Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman  (CSIDH) key establishment protocol, how naïve constant-time implementations could be vulnerable to fault attacks, and several techniques from the literature which can be used to combat those attacks.

In 1977, Solomon defined a lattice zeta function counting the number of full-rank sublattices of Z^d of any given index, and found a “rational" formula in terms of the Riemann zeta function. We study a “singular" analog of the lattice zeta function by replacing Z by Fq[[T^2,T^3]], the ring of a cusp singularity, and we prove a rationality result. One important ingredient involves introducing a fun combinatorial construction, which is some ``spiral shifting'' operators acting on the set of d-tuples of nonnegative integers. I will use concrete examples to demonstrate several nice properties of these operators, hopefully interactively. I will then explain how this construction is applied to the rationality of the lattice zeta function. This talk is based on joint work with Ruofan Jiang.

This talk explores the connections between the maximum number of zeros of equations over finite fields and generalized Hamming weights. We show how the two problems are related and present different approaches used to solve them. Specifically, we discuss how to compute the maximum number of zeros, provide bounds, and design algorithms. We illustrate these approaches with examples and discuss open problems and future directions for research.

          An endomorphism of an elliptic curve satisfies a degree two charateristic polynomial
          with integer coefficients,
          and the degree-one coefficient is its trace. An algorithm for computing the trace of
          the Frobenius endomorphism of an elliptic curve defined over a
          finite field yields an algorithm for point counting on elliptic curves. Schoof gave the first such polynomial-time algorithm, which
          was later improved by Elkies and Atkin resulting in the celebrated SEA
          algorithm. When the elliptic curve is supersingular, computing the traces
          of its endomorphisms is a critical subroutine in algorithms for
          computing the structure of the endomorphism ring as a quaternion algebra.
          In this talk, we will give an exposition of Schoof's algorithm, a taste
          of Elkies' improvements, and discuss novel, asymptotic speedups to a  generalization of
          Schoof's algorithm for computing the trace of an endomorphism of a
          supersingular elliptic cuve. In particular, our algorithm achieves a
          runtime which is quartic in its input size assuming only the generalized
          Riemann hypothesis -- without additional hypotheses, the SEA algorithm
          is no faster (asymptotically) than Schoof's algorithm, even under GRH. This is joint work with
          Jana Sotakova and Michael Wills.

In the first part of this talk, we will consider the flag variety X=Fl(1,2,3)
parametrizing pairs (p,l), where l is a line in the complex projective plane,
and p is a point on l. In particular, we will discuss maps from the projective
line to X satisfying natural constraints. Such maps come in families which are
varieties themselves. Moreover, these varieties have arithmetic genus 0.

This example fits into the broader study of the quantum K-theory of flag
varieties. In the second part of the talk, I will give a gentle introduction to
this subject and outline my past and current work on the quantum K-theory of the

      An elliptic curve is a curve in projective space whose points can be given the structure of an abelian group. In this talk, we will focus on torsion points, which are points having finite order under this group law. While we can generally determine the torsion points of a fixed elliptic curve defined over a number field, there are several open problems which require controlling the existence of torsion points within infinite families of elliptic curves. Success stories include Merel's Uniform Boundedness Theorem, which states that the order of a torsion point can be bounded by the degree of its field of definition. On the other hand, a proof of Serre's Uniformity Conjecture---which has been open for 50 years---would in particular imply that for sufficiently large primes $p$, there do not exist points of order $p^2$ arising on elliptic curves defined over field extensions of ``unusually low degree."


      In this talk, I will give a brief introduction to the arithmetic of elliptic curves before addressing the problem of identifying elliptic curves producing a point of large order in usually low degree, i.e., those possessing a sporadic torsion point. More precisely, let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a field extension $F/\mathbb{Q}$ of degree $d$, and let $P$ be a point of order $N$ with coordinates in $F$. Such a point is called ``rational" since it is defined over the same field as $E$. We say $P$ is sporadic if, as one ranges over all fields $F/\mathbb{Q}$ of degree at most $d$ and all elliptic curves $E/F$, there are only finitely many elliptic curves which possess a rational point of order $N$. Sporadic pairs $(E,P)$ correspond to exceptional points on modular curves, which are points whose existence is not explained by standard geometric constructions.

In the first part of the talk, I will present formulas for holomorphic Euler characteristics of tautological bundles over Quot schemes (based on joint work with Prof. Dragos Oprea). We note a surprising analogy with the Hilbert scheme of points on surfaces. In the second part of the talk, I will describe the celebrated Vafa-Intriligator formula in the context of Quot schemes, and I will report on a Vafa-Intriligator type formula for (rank 2) isotropic Quot schemes. Furthermore, I will compare this formula with Gromov-Ruan-Witten invariants of (rank 2) isotropic Grassmannians.

      One of the most important results in coding theory is the MacWilliams Theorem (1962), which is known
as the "MacWilliams identities", and relates the weight enumerator of a linear code and the weight
enumerator of its dual code.
Coding theory has also been developed with respect to alternative metrics. One of the most studied
of those metrics is the NRT metric, which was introduced to study array codes. The NRT metric was
introduced by Rosenbloom and Tsfasman in [1]. In this same paper the authors pointed out that the NRT
metric models transmission over a set of parallel channels subject to fading.

In this talk, we will see how we can apply polynomial invariant theory to describe the shape enumer-
ator of self-dual NRT metric codes in Mn,2(F2). The new results in this talk are in [2]

      Francisco, Mermin, and Schweig introduced the concept of Q-Borel ideals as a generalization of Borel ideals (also called strongly stable ideals). Using a poset Q and a monomial m, we can build a large monomial ideal and many of its properties can be read by just looking at the pair (Q,m). In this talk, we determine some of these properties, in particular the symbolic powers of principal Q-Borel ideals.

I will investigate certain matrix enumeration problems over a finite field, guided by the phenomenon that many such problems tend to have a generating function with a nice factorization. I then give a uniform and geometric explanation of the phenomenon that works in many cases, using the statistics of finite-length modules (or coherent sheaves) studied by Cohen and Lenstra. However, my recent work on counting pairs of matrices of the form AB=BA=0 (arXiv: 2110.15566) and AB=uBA for a root of unity u (arXiv: 2110.15570), through purely combinatorial methods, gives examples where the phenomenon still holds true in the absence of the above explanation. Time permitting, I will talk about a partial progress on the system of equations AB=BA, A^2=B^3 in a joint work with Ruofan Jiang. In particular, it verifies a pattern that I previously conjectured in an attempt to explain the phenomenon in the AB=BA=0 case geometrically.

We will begin the talk by describing a central construction in the arithmetic of characteristic-p function fields: Drinfeld modules and t-motives. We will then describe our recent result which allows us to make some progress on an important deficiency in the area, the lack of integration theory.  We will describe two pairings between the t-motive and the dual t-motive associated to a t-module which provide an algebraic alternative to integration. Specializations of these pairings allow us to give explicit formulas for the exponential and logarithmic functions of the t-module. We also explain a few applications of these pairings, such as a Mellin transform-like formula for Carlitz zeta values.
