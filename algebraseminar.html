          The modular curve X1(N) parametrizes elliptic curves (whose points form an abelian group under a geometric group law) with a marked point of order N. A point on X1(N) is isolated if, roughly speaking, it is not a member of an infinite family of points parametrized by a geometric object. Elliptic curves without CM naturally give isolated points on X1(N), but the non-CM points remain mysterious. We develop an algorithm to test whether an elliptic curve E/Q without complex multiplication gives rise to an isolated point of any degree on any modular curve of the form X1(N). Running this algorithm on all elliptic curves presently in the L-functions and Modular Forms Database and the Stein-Watkins Database gives strong evidence for our conjecture that only finitely many rational j-invariants give rise to an isolated point on X1(N) for any N; our conjectured list is explicit. This is joint work with Bourdon, Hashimoto, Keller, Klagsburn, Najman, and Shukla.

          Gu, Mihalcea, Sharpe, Xu, Zhang, and Zhou proposed a conjectural presentation of the equivariant quantum K-ring of partial flag varieties, inspired by insights from quantum field theory in physics. In this talk, we will explain a proof of these conjectures based on the Toda presentation obtained by Maeno, Naito, and Sagaki for the complete flag variety Fl(n), as well as Kato’s algebra homomorphism from the quantum K-ring of Fl(n) to a partial flag variety.

          The equivariant quantum K-theory ring of a flag variety is a Frobenius algebra equipped with a perfect pairing called the quantum K-metric. It is known that in the classical K-theory ring for a given flag variety the ideal sheaf basis is dual to the Schubert basis with regard to the sheaf Euler characteristic. We define a quantization of the ideal sheaf basis for the equivariant quantum K-theory of cominuscule flag varieties. These quantized ideal sheaves are then dual to the Schubert basis with regard to the quantum K-metric. We provide explicit type-uniform combinatorial formulae for the quantized ideal sheaves in terms of the Schubert basis for any cominuscule flag variety.

          Research in math education has produced models for how children construct number. They construct an additive world of numbers through iterations of units of 1; and they construct a multiplicative world of numbers through transformations of units, From this childish perspective, the prime number theorem can be understood as a mapping between worlds: the natural logarithm maps a multiplicatively nested sequence of numbers (up to n) to an additively nested sequence of numbers (n). In this talk, I will share possible approaches to proving the prime number theorem by leveraging this understanding of the theorem. I’m hoping members of the algebra group can provide further insight for completing a truly simple proof of the theorem.

          Given a nodal genus one curve and a proper subcurve of genus one, we will construct a contraction that collapses the subcurve to a genus one singularity. We will do this by first introducing residues for curves over local artinian rings and "twists" of these residues by tropical data from the curve, then we will use these residues to explicitly construct the contraction.

          Affine geometry plays a crucial role in understanding transformations that preserve
          geometric structures. A key result is the fundamental theorem of affine geometry, which
          states that a bijective map between affine spaces that preserves collinearity (i.e., maps
          lines onto lines) must be a semi-affine map. An interesting application of the fundamental
          theorem of affine geometry to algebraic coding theory is in characterizing the permutation
          automorphisms of Reed-Muller codes. In their seminal paper in 1993, Berger and Charpin
          determined the permutation automorphism groups of Reed-Muller codes, showing that it
          is the affine general linear group. In this talk, we introduce affine spaces, outline a proof
          of the fundamental theorem of affine geometry, and explore its applications to coding
          theory, particularly in the context of Reed-Muller codes and their generalizations. We
          will also state a related open problem. If there is time and interest, we may outline some
          recent progress on this open problem. The latter is an ongoing joint work with Eduardo
          Camps Moreno, Sudhir R. Ghorpade and Hiram H. L&oacutepez.

          Let X --> Y be a morphism of varieties and k a field. Consider the set X(k) of k-points, or solutions to the equations defining X with coordinates in k. If X = V(x^2 + y^2 - 1) for example, then the set of Q-points consists of primitive Pythagorean triples and the geometry of X shows there are infinitely many solutions. According to Hindry-Silverman, "Geometry determines Arithmetic."
We want to determine the image of the map on k-points X(k) --> Y(k). Suppose X --> Y arises as the fiber over 0 of a family of varieties X' --> Y'. The geometry of the family X' --> Y' can also constrain the type of k-points that land in the image of X(k) --> Y(k), as Campana observed. Abramovich generalized this notion in a beautiful, incomplete manuscript called "birational geometry for number theorists" and gave us permission to realize this vision using log geometry. Log structures on X, Y remember enough about the families X', Y' to constrain the rational points. Joint work with Sara Mehidi, Marta Pieropan, Thibault Poiret.
