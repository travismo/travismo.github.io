              I will discuss polynomial approximation problems on the n-dimensional hypercube, focusing on quantitative estimates of the approximation error as n grows. This topic represents a burgeoning area in the analysis of Boolean functions—one that is far less understood than its classical counterpart on the real line. I will present several recent results together with its applications, as well as highlight ongoing challenges and open problems in the field.

              A polynomial over a field is square-free supported if every variable appearing in it has degree at most one. Interest in such polynomials arises from matroid support polynomials, studied by Bath and Walther. In this talk, we will provide an overview of the study of singularities in prime characteristic via the Frobenius map. We will show that the algebraic variety defined by an irreducible polynomial with square-free support has mild singularities, answering a question posed by Bath, Mustață, and Walther. We will also discuss the consequences of these results, including their implications in characteristic zero.

              The Schrödinger equation is the foundational equation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Studying the time-independent part leads to the eigenvalue equation of a Schrödinger operator, whose spectra contain a wealth of information about the underlying quantum system. We will survey some results about Schrödinger operators having exotic properties, such as spectra that can be "thin" Cantor sets.

              I will discuss the connection between the classical isoperimetric inequality and the critical mass problem in nuclear fission, which is described by the liquid drop model. Techniques developed for this problem are also helpful in establishing certain universality results for large atoms, particularly in relation to the ionization problem in quantum physics: How many electrons can a nucleus bind?

              How do we check if two vectors are orthogonal? We compute their dot product, which by definition takes two vectors as inputs. How do we check if two functions are orthogonal? We compute their inner product, which by definition takes two functions as inputs. Why only two? What would it mean for 4 functions to be “orthogonal”? Or 8 functions? Or 7 functions? Let’s call this superorthogonality. What can we deduce about collections of functions that are superorthogonal? In this accessible talk, we will explore how accidental encounters with papers spanning 90 years led to a systematic investigation of these questions, and a way to see that previously “unrelated” theorems in harmonic analysis and number theory share a very interesting structure deep under their surface.

              Classical Reed-Muller codes form a well-known family of binary codes on the cubical complex, which also gives rise to a family of quantum codes. In the first part of the talk we extend the construction of the classical RM family to binary codes defined on an arbitrary finite Coxeter complex and establish basic properties of the new code class. In the second part we present a geometric description of a set of transversal logical operators of quantum RM codes. The talk assumes no background in coding theory or quantum computations, developing the constructions from the first principles. We will define classical and quantum codes and discuss the motivation for the construction of their logical operators. Based on joint works with Nolan Coble, Dominik Hangleiter, and Christopher Kang.

              This talk presents “partition theoretic” analogs of the classical work of Matiyasevich that resolved Hilbert’s Tenth Problem in the negative. The Diophantine equations we consider involve equations of MacMahon’s partition functions and their natural generalizations. Here we explicitly construct infinitely many Diophantine equations in partition functions whose solutions are precisely the prime numbers. To this end, we produce explicit additive bases of all graded weights of quasimodular forms, which is of independent interest with many further applications. This is joint work with Will Craig and Jan-Willem van Ittersum, and this paper was awarded Runner-Up recognition for the 2025 Cozzarelli Prize by the US National Academy of Sciences.
